### 🤖Telegram Bot Service(under construction...)

Chaty can also deploy Telegram Bot service, enabling your users to chat with Chaty in Telegram. Simply send a message to '@your-bot' to initiate the chatbot service.

## Troubleshooting  
1. If your network cannot access [https://api.openai.com](https://api.openai.com), you can try run  
```
chaty proxy default
```
as a temporary proxy solution.  
For a long-term solution, it is recommended to run on a server that supports accessing <code>api.openai.com</code> or use a stable proxy.

2. when you got error like below(wechat security authorization). Auth your wechat account(me->Pay->upper right corner···->Real-Name Authentication).
```
uncaughtException AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: 1 == 0
```
